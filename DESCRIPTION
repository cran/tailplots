Description: Estimators for two functionals used to detect Gamma or Pareto distributions, as well as distributions exhibiting similar tail behavior, as introduced by Iwashita and Klar (2023) <doi:10.1111/stan.12316> and Klar (2024) <doi:10.1080/00031305.2024.2413081>. 
            One of these functionals, g, originally proposed by Asmussen and Lehtomaa (2017) <doi:10.3390/risks5010010>, distinguishes between log-convex and log-concave tail behavior. 
            The package also includes methods for visualizing these estimators and their associated confidence intervals across various threshold values.
